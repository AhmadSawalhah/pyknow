FactTypes
---------

Fact's values must be a facttype instantiated,
that is:

    - ``pyknow.fact.L`` - Literal
    - ``pyknow.fact.W`` - Wildcard
    - ``pyknow.fact.C`` - Capture
    - ``pyknow.fact.T`` - Test (callable)
    - ``pyknow.fact.V`` - Value (captured value)
    - ``pyknow.fact.N`` - NOT value (captured value)

In this module we provide those facttypes and its
helper methods, plus the valueset objects we'll use
to group them and match them by type.

Fact matching process is as follows::

    - Fact.matches(other) -> extract fact's keys and values
                          -> extract other's keys and values
                          -> If not all our keys are present in other's keys
                             return False
                          -> If our type is not the same as the other, return
                             False
                          -> group ours' and others' values by FactType
                          -> compare each group, if any of them returns
                             False (that'll mean both have the KEY but
                             non-matching values) return False
                          -> Return True
