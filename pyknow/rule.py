Connective Constraints
++++++++++++++++++++++

Pyknow approach to a KE makes it mandatory for all the arguments to be
named, that is, no positional arguments here.

Connective constraints are AND, OR and NOT.

All Connective Constraints MUST be enclosed in Rule decorators,
and only contain Fact objects.

>>> from pyknow.rule import AND, Rule
>>> from pyknow.fact import Fact, L
>>> from pyknow.engine import KnowledgeEngine

>>> def foo():
...    class RefrigeratorLogic(KnowledgeEngine):
...        food_spoiled = False
...        @Rule(AND(Fact(light=L("on")), Fact(door=L("open"))))
...        def food_spoiled(self):
...            self.food_spoiled = True
...    ke = RefrigeratorLogic()
...    ke.reset()
...    ke.declare(Fact(light="on"))
...    ke.declare(Fact(door="open"))
...    ke.run()
...    return ke.food_spoiled
