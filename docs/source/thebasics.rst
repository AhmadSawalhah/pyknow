The Basics
==========

An expert system is a program capable of pair up a set of **facts** with
a set of **rules** to those facts, and execute some actions based on the
matching rules.


Facts
-----

`Facts` are the basic unit of information of PyKnow. They are used by
the system to reason about the problem.

Let's enumerate some facts about `Facts`, so... metafacts ;)

#. The class `Fact` is a subclass of `dict`.

   .. code-block:: python

      >>> f = Fact(a=1, b=2)
      >>> f['a']
      1

#. Therefore a `Fact` does not mantain an internal order of items.

   .. code-block:: python

      >>> Fact(a=1, b=2)  # Order is arbirary :O
      Fact(b=2, a=1)


#. In contrast to `dict`, you can create a `Fact` without keys (only
   values), and `Fact` will create a numeric index for your values.

   .. code-block:: python

      >>> f = Fact('x', 'y', 'z')
      >>> f[0]
      'x'


#. You can mix autonumeric values with key-values, but autonumeric must
   be first:

   .. code-block:: python

      >>> f = Fact('x', 'y', 'z', a=1, b=2)
      >>> f[1]
      'y'
      >>> f['b']
      2

#. You can subclass `Fact` to express different kind of data or extend
   it with your custom functionality.

   .. code-block:: python

      class Alert(Fact):
          """The alert level."""
          pass

      class Status(Fact):
          """The system status."""
          pass

      f1 = Alert('red')
      f2 = Status('critical')


   .. code-block:: python

      from pyknow import Fact
      from django.contrib.auth.models import User as DjangoUser

      class User(Fact):
          @classmethod
          def from_django_model(cls, obj):
              return cls(pk=obj.pk,
                         name=obj.name,
                         email=obj.email)

          def save_to_db(self):
              return DjangoUser.create(**self)


Rules
-----

In PyKnow a **rule** is a callable decorated with the `Rule` decorator.

The rule have two components, the LHS (left-hand-side) and the RHS
(right-hand-side).

* The *LHS* describe (using **patterns**) the conditions on which the rule
  * should be executed (or fired).

* The *RHS* is the set of actions to perform when the rule is fired.

For a `Fact` to match a `Pattern`, all pattern restrictions must be
**True** when the `Fact` is evaluated against it.

.. code-block:: python

   class MyFact(Fact):
       pass
  
   @Rule(MyFact())  # This is the LHS
   def match_with_every_myfact():
       """This rule will match with every instance of `MyFact`."""
       # This is the RHS
       pass 

   @Rule(Fact('animal', family='felinae'))
   def match_with_cats():
       """
       Match with every `Fact` which:

         * f[0] == 'animal'
         * f['family'] == 'felinae'

       """
       print("Meow!")

You can use logic operators to express complex *LHS* conditions.

.. code-block:: python

   @Rule((User('admin') | User('root'))
         & ~Fact('drop-privileges'))
   def the_user_has_power():
       """
       The user is a privileged one and we are not dropping privileges.

       """
       enable_superpowers()


For a `Rule` to be useful must be a method of a subclass of `KnowledgeEngine`.


`Facts` vs `Patterns`
---------------------

The difference between `Facts` and `Patterns` is small. In fact,
`Patterns` are just `Facts` containing **Pattern Conditional Elements**
instead of regular data. They are used only in the *LHS* of a rule.

If you don't provide the content of a pattern as a **PCE**, PyKnow will
enclose the value in a `LiteralPCE` automatically for you.

Also, you can't declare any Fact containing a **PCE**, if you do, you
will receive a nice exception back.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> ke = KnowledgeEngine()
   >>> ke.declare(Fact(L("hi")))
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<ipython-input-4-b36cff89278d>", line 1, in <module>
       ke.declare(Fact(L('hi')))
     File "/home/pyknow/pyknow/engine.py", line 210, in declare
       self.__declare(*facts)
     File "/home/pyknow/pyknow/engine.py", line 191, in __declare
       "Declared facts cannot contain conditional elements")
   TypeError: Declared facts cannot contain conditional elements


KnowledgeEngine
---------------

This is where all the magic happens.

The first step is to make a subclass of it and use `Rule` to decorate its
methods.

After that you can instantiate, populate with facts, and finally run it.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: greet.py

   from pyknow import *

   class Greetings(KnowledgeEngine):
       @Rule(Fact(action='greet'),
             NOT(Fact(name=W())))
       def ask_name(self):
           self.declare(Fact(name=input("What's your name? ")))

       @Rule(Fact(action='greet'),
             NOT(Fact(location=W())))
       def ask_location(self):
           self.declare(Fact(location=input("Where are you? ")))

       @Rule(Fact(action='greet'),
             Fact(name="name" << W()),
             Fact(location="location" << W()))
       def greet(self, name, location):
           print("Hi %s! How is the weather in %s?" % (name, location))

   engine = Greetings()
   engine.deffacts(Fact(action="greet"))
   engine.reset()  # Prepare the engine for the execution.
   engine.run()  # Run it!


.. code-block:: bash

   $ python greet.py
   What's your name? Roberto
   Where are you? Madrid
   Hi Roberto! How is the weather in Madrid?


Cycle of execution: deffacts, reset & run
-----------------------------------------

Because this topic is often a direct cause of misunderstanding, it
deserves a special mention here, in the basics.

For a KnowledgeEngine to run, this things must happen:

#. The class must be instantiated, of course.

#. (OPTIONAL) Some facts can be declared using the `deffacts` method.
   This stores the facts internally.

#. The method **reset** must be called:
   
   * This declares the special fact *InitialFact*. Necessary for some
     rules to work properly.

   * All facts declared with `deffacts` are declared.

#. The method **run** must be called. This starts the cycle of execution.


Differences between `deffacts` and `declare`
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Both methods are used to declare facts on the engine instance, but:

* `declare` adds the facts directly to the working memory.

* `deffacts` stores the facts in a special permanent memory, and every
    time **reset** is called, the facts are added to the working memory
    using `declare`.
